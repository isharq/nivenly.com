This is an independently published book about modeling the tech industry.

Learn how to model computers, humans, money, and their subsequent relationships for your own personal gain.


### Written For Less Privileged Technologists

This book is relevant for anyone in tech, however it is specifically designed to give less privileged technologists (LGBTQ, People of Color, Women, Non-binary, Gender minorities, Neurodivergent, etc...) a set of tools in aiding their ability to exploit a fundamentally broken system.

Learn how the privileged at the top think about the industry, so you can out smart them.

This book is written from my perspective.
In my eyes, I view myself as a successful transgender hacker. 
I work directly with the Linux kernel and Kubernetes, as well as the open source organizations backing each of them.
