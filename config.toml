# Here is where the dynamic interpolating happens.
#
# We have "Upgradde"d hugo (Two D's for a Double-Dose of pimping).
#
# This is where we can mapp the interpolation with Hugo, to the
# Interpolation with the Go runtime.
# Basically set a key equal to what you want to pull from the
# Nivenly "app" (which runs with bjorno) here. Then you can access
# the value dynamically in the page elsewhere.
#
# Nóva: Try to only use the bjorno runtime params here. For everything
#       else try to define above as a site vairable {{ $.Site.Key }}

  # Example Param:
  #
  # key = "value"
